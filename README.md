# Fikra Hadi Ramadhan - BossHire Test

## Getting Started

First, install the package with:

```bash
yarn install
```

Next, run the apps with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Feature

- Login Page
- Cart Page
- Add Cart Page
- Product Detail Pop Up

## Future Suggestion - For Dev

- More clean
- Add some micro interaction / animation
- Can use react toast for notification instead of Snackbar
- More responsive
- Better pallete
- Split the code into some component

## Future Suggestion - For BossHire Team

- The docs of API should be same with the actual API
- The response for API Login is only token, maybe can add the other information like "userId", and for now I think the "token" itself is not necessary (?) CMIIW
- Give the password through response API is not necessary at all, maybe can remove it from API
- 

### Thanks
